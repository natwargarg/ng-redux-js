/**
 * Redux basic example using only javascript - * Use-case - dispatch (increment and decrement ) actions to update application state
 * # Core Principles/Rules of Redux #
    1.  The entire state of the application will be represented by one JavaScript object. This is also referred to as the Javascript State Tree. [[ no mutation here! ]]
    
    2.  State tree is read only. This means we will never directly manipulate values of our state tree. State will be updated / changed by dispatched actions (weâ€™ll discuss this soon).
    
    3.  The reducer function. Inside a redux app there is one particular function that takes the previous state and the action being dispatched, and returns the next state of the application.
